# DetermineDropletState
Derda Research Group MATLAB code for determining droplet time of ice nucleation based on experimental images

This was created to analyze images produced in an antifreeze peptide screening experiment, where hundreds of accumulated images are taken on 10 - 20 second intervals. Since manual determination of droplet freezing point was time consuming and mistakes are common, this program was written to streamline, simplify and shorten the time of analysis.

Created in Spring 2017
